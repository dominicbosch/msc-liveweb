% why are we now suddenly responsive? we loosened up certain things

Existing ECA systems (List examples) all act on local data.
Looking at (Wikipedia...) their definition is actions on local data.
This does only add reactivity to these systems and not to the Web per se.

Such systems are merely event sinks which add fairly any value to the Web, except for the individual users and the system itself.
We are taking a step further and allow not only the chaining up of several remote ECA engines, but also the invocation of actions on any arbitrary Web accessible service.
