% TODO introduce heterogenous term
% It is a promising research field that leads towards event-driven reactivity of the Web through programmability.
The Web is a heterogenous collection of data and services.
A large set of this Web information space is dynamic and changes within it are covered by the event space.
In our work we describe a conceptual model, which makes the Web reactive by listening for events and executing actions in the information space, according to predefined rules.
Since a large part of the event space is not ready to be actively distributed to listeners,
