\chapter*{Abstract}

The Web is a huge information space of heterogenous data and functionality resources, and it is growing rapidly.
A large subset of this information space is dynamic and state changes within it are covered by events in the Web's event space.
In our work we describe an event-based conceptual model, which allows complex event detection and uses the Web's programmability to dispatch actions, according to user-defined rules.
Through our model we allow the composition of Web resources based on an event-driven architecture, a procedure which pushes towards the vision of a real-time reactive Web.
