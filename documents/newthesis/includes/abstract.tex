\chapter*{Abstract}

The Web is a rapidly growing information universe, consisting of information systems that provide access over heterogeneous services.
The majority of those information systems are dynamic and changes in their information space can be modeled as events.
Apart from modeling such changes as events to be detected, they can also be modeled as actions when imposed onto the information space.
If appropriate services exist to access such an information system for read and write operations, we are able to orchestrate it.
By modeling information space changes as events and actions, we are able to introduce an event-based conceptual model, which enables the detection of events and the dispatching of actions according to predefined rules, thus imposing reactivity on top the involved information systems.
Since our model bases on information systems and their services, it is not limited to the Web, but can include any in a way accessible information system.
In our work we introduce a prototype system which uses the Web's programmability to impose reactivity on the Web.
Through our prototype it is possible to orchestrate Web resources based on an event-driven architecture, a method which pushes towards the vision of real-time reactive information systems.
