Research on behalf of the web, its development over the years and its possibilities attracts a great deal of attention.
This is not surprising since modern business and life is already impossible without the internet.
Great opportunities arise with it and we cover a part of the web service orchestration in it.

\index{Web Service}
\index{Web API}
An important development within the web are the increasing number of available services.
The term service in the web is not very precise and the web's short history has already seen a lot of different kinds.

\index{RPC}
One early concept of such services are Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)~\cite{Birrell:1984:IRP:2080.357392}, which found also application in grid computing~\cite{seymour2002overview}.
RPC themselves weren't necessarily issued over the web, but often via inter-process communication.
Through RPC a piece of code can be executed on another machine than the one which is calling the procedure.
This opened doors into the field of distributed computation.
RPC has been implemented in a lot of differrent programming languages and with different sorts of technologies, which resulted in incomptaiblity among each other.
\index{XML}
\index{XML-RPC}
By abstracting RPC functionality with the Extensible Markup Language (XML)~\cite{bray1998extensible}, compatibility between services was easier to achieve and didn't prerequisite a certain architecture anymore.
XML-RPC was held relatively simple and allowed for several input parameters while one value was returned.
\index{SOAP}
\index{WSDL}
Together with additional functionality, XML-RPC turned into Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)~\cite{box2000simple}, accompanied by the Web Service Description Language (WSDL)~\cite{christensen2001web} which is used to describe the interfaces to SOAP services.
Through this technology a potential client for the service can make a request to the WSDL file and retrieves all interface information he requires in order to issue a call to the actual service.
SOAP is then basically just the marshalling

An interesting trend that could be observed was the growing popularity of REST over SOAP.~\cite{ploscar2012xml}

Twelve Theses on Reactive Rules for the Web~\cite{10.1007-11896548_63}:
This article investigates issues of relevance in designing high-level
programming languages dedicated to reactivity on the Web. It presents
twelve theses on features desirable for a language of reactive rules tuned
to programming Web and Semantic Web applications.
% MY NOTES: they argue with soap and expect it to stay. They expect web sites to inform each other about update requests. we are taking one step further and provide events to whomeever wants to receive them while being greedy about receiving events. give them to meeeeh my prciouzzz eventz!
% 1. High-level reactive languges are needed, ECA rules well-suited to specify reactivity
% 2. Reactive Web rules should be processed locally and act globally through event-based communication and access to persistent Web data
% 3. Events are best exchanged directly between Web sites in a push manner
% 4. Events are volatile data and should be kept distinct from persistent data.
% 5. Recognizing composite events is essential for a reactive Web language. Composite events are conveniently specified by (event) queries. There are (at least) four complementary dimensions to event queries: data extraction, event composition, temporal conditions, and event accumulation --> Future Work (CEP), data extraction already implemented
% 6. A data-driven, incremental evaluation of event queries is the approach of choice
% 7. Data from persistent Web resources plays an essential role for Web reactivity. A reactive language thus should embed or build upon a Web query language.
% 8. The Web is a dynamic, state-changing system. Reactions to state changes (events) through reactive rules are state-changing actions such as updates to persistent data. Reactive rules are needed where compound actions can be constructed from primitive actions.
% 9. Development and maintenance of reactive rule programs can be considerably supported by structuring mechanisms such as: branching in rules, deductive rules for event queries and Web queries, procedural abstractions for actions, and grouping of rules. --> Future work, attach several conditions and their actions branches to one event instead of creating rules for each of them. EC^nA^n. (Though procedural abstractions for actions already implemented, defining complex actions to be reused by rules)
% 10.Identity of data items is an issue for reactive languages due to their ability to react to changes of data objects on the Web. (we had surrogate identity though discarded the concept again... stupido)
% 11. Meta-programming and meta-circularity, that is, the ability to use rules to exchange and evaluate (other) rules, are needed in some important cases. (quite artificial for our scenarios)
% 12.Reactivity in the Web’s open and uncontrolled world requires language support for authentication, authorization, and accounting. (phew... let's let others go there)

% The services and their correlations can be treated as a complex system with self-organize and continuous co-evolution properties, which is called service ecosystem.
% In service ecosystems, dynamic factors are general and may affect the performance of the whole system by spreading through the correlations.

% The transformation from traditional industry model of software to SaaS (Software as a Service) greatly changes the academic and economic domain of software, which brings about the prevalent research trend of service science [1].

% The Web is now programmable.
% This fact has been facilitated and accelerated by Web data’s availability as structured XML feeds (such as RSS and Atom) and by the externalization of Web application interactions through application programming interfaces.

Data and functionalities in the web were always accessible via web services, whatever this means.
reengineering of services in the beginning
with standardised REST API's we got to Web API, easy access and understandable


The fast evolving web has brought up a trend towards easy to master interfaces to services, the so called Web APIs.
They do not only provide access to mere services but whole applications that allow access over Web APIs.
These trending Web APIs benefit from a RESTful architecture which predominantly uses HTTP and thus relies on the most basic and powerful operations and the basis of the Web itself, the HTTP protocol.

\index{Mashups}
Mashups combine information and functionality of more than one web service in a single place.
The mashing up of such web services allows data to be enhanced with new informations, processing / refinement of the information, or even ways to interact with them, e.g. through Google Maps.
Simple functions from different sources can be combined into more powerful ones, which influence data and services in a way their founders eventually didn't even think of.
Web service mashups have been developped ever since services in the web started to exist and were accessible in a more or less convenient way.
We introduce Paul Rademacher as an example for how recent the invention of web service mashups are.
He's one of the first inventors of such a web service mashup.
In the same year after Google Maps came up in 2005, he invented a site~\cite{wwwRademacherOne,wwwRademacherTwo} that displayed Craigslist houses on a Google Map.
With no Google Maps API at that time, he needed time and skills to reverse engineer Google Map's functionalities.


A large number of such "static" mashups were and are still developped.
They are static in the way that they aggregate a fixed (and mostly low) number, of either data or functionality resources, to provide an enhanced resource in a specialized domain.
Of course Mashups can be mashed up again, to provide even more sophisticated functionality and data.
Some latest example Mashups, taken from the ProgrammableWeb~\cite{wwwProgrammableWeb} collection, are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Wifi and Plugs~\cite{wwwWifiAndPlugs}: MapBox, Google Docs and Import.io API's used to display where Wi-Fi and plugs are available in London.
  \item MapLight~\cite{wwwMapLight}: GovTrack.us and OpenSecrets API's used to combine political results with financial contributions to show how capital contributions affect voting.
  \item Shared Count~\cite{wwwSharedCount}: Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Twitter API's used to display informations about how well spread a URL is on social media sites.
\end{itemize}

In the past few years, research and development for platforms to allow users to flexibly mashup Web APIs got attention.
% Web API mashups
With IFTTT and Zapier, two platforms have evolved out of this process.
Users that register on those platforms are provided with a multitude of Web API functions that act as event triggers and such that are used to execute actions.
The user is then free to combine these event triggers and actions in the way it suits best, creating helpful Web API mashups on their own.

% Since this is a quite new field the why and how is hidden from the research.
% you need events
% you need rules / rule language

% TODO REST paper, Craigslist artcile / Paper

It turns out that Web API mashing up is not able to bring reactivity to the web.
They are merely aggregations of services that only provide data or functions but no write possibilities such as web applications provide.
% only limited functionalty
% limited parametrization
% often only read / new aggregation / no writes
% TODO find mashup that does writes in a system! (not existing right?)

Thus

%TODO Table with categorization of Rule languages

Several different rule languages have been developped for different purposes over the last years and they vary grately in their purpose.
% terms of usability for ECA Rules together with Web API mashups.
A compilation of research on different emerging rule-based languages and technologies ~\cite{2009-Paschke_Boley-RCER.pdf} gives an oveview over such efforts.
We examined different existing rule languages with respect to a certain use case to identify its applicability for reactivity in the web. % TODO find other word as applicability
The use case is defined such that the rule needs to suffice the ECA paradigm:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Event: Receipt of an Email
  \item Condition: Check for a certain sender
  \item Action: Store it remotely via a Web API
\end{itemize}

We defined an email event which the rule languages need to be able to process.
The JSON representation of the given email event as depicted in the appendix. %is shown in Listing~\ref{lstemail}.

% FIXME Leave out what was not inspiring!

\index{RDF}
\index{XML}
An early ECA Rule Language for XML repositories~\cite{Papamarkos03event-condition-actionrule} was postulated in 2003 and was picked up by many researches afterwards. It was designed to react on insert and delete events within XML repositories and as an action change XML documents.


Now apart from implementing a rules engine, we would also need to add an XML document event manager which interpretes and pushes events into the XML file \emph{inbound\_queue.xml}. Then again this instance would interprete the ouptuts of the ECA engine, which would theoretically manifest in other XML documents, and produce meaningful actions on remote hosts. This wouldn't be an architecture which has its focus on the solution of our use case and, as a result, add complexity and create an unnecessary overhead.

\index{Notation 3}
To make the lengthy RDF definitions smaller and more readable, Notation 3~\cite{wwwn3} was designed and announced in 2005. Through the implies operator(=\textgreater) an "event" can be connected to an "action", both expressed in RDF's subject, predicate, object notation, which makes the expression of ECA rules a complicated and not very intuitive task. A solution to our use case would look as follows:

This language is used to express relations between entities and thus not really suitable for our use case, since we would require another interpreter to infer the actions. But concepts and ideas of the work that was done in these consortias could eventually still find influence into our solution.

\index{XChange}\index{Xcerpt}
The rule language XChange~\cite{2005-Patranjan-TLE.pdf} was the outcome of the REWERSE (~\cite{wwwRewerse}, Reasoning on the Web with Rules and Semantics) project, which was funded by the EU and Switzerland. Their work influenced a number of future research. The language was designed to add reactive behaviour to a "static" web which is represented through XML resources. Thus we have action logics to alter such resources through insertions and deletions. Since we aim to utilize web API's for our rule language we need a more generic approach which adds flexibility in term of the API provided. But the thorough research done with the language XChange holds valuable concepts, especially in terms of temporal evet composition. This could be a rule according to our use case:


But XChange is designed to access other resources in an action and thus provides powerful tools:

\index{JSON Rules}
In 2008 \emph{JSON Rules}~~\cite{2008-Giurca_Pascalau-JSON_Rules.pdf} was introduced as a language to easily react on specific DOM tree compositions.
The usage of JavaScript allowed them to provide simple functions which could be called directly by the actions, thus abstracting functionality from the language.
This key concept found influence into our language as it allows different layers of abstractions.
Through this it is possible to provide generic functions for expert user as well as very limited functions with only few possibilities for parameterization to be used by unexperienced persons.
A drawback of this language is its binding to DOM tree events, where we would want to react on any events happening in the world.
Also the temporal composition to complex events is not a subject of their work and needs further attention.


\index{KRL}
A recent open-source development is the Kinetic Rules Engine together with the Kinetics Rule Language~~\cite{bookTheLiveWeb}.
It is built for the purpose of adding reactivity to the cloud.
The language is based on declarative syntax, enriched with imparative elements.
But it is a tedious task to get into a whole new language and their caveats.
\emph{authorization?}


\index{RuleML}
The basis of \emph{RuleML}~~\cite{2006-Boley-RuleML.pdf} is datalog, a language in the intersection of SQL and Prolog.
In 2012 the \emph{Reaction RuleML}~~\cite{2012-Paschke_etal-ReactionRuleML.pdf} language incorporated several different types of rules into the RuleML syntax, to establish a uniform syntax and interchangability of rules.
\emph{Reaction RuleML} is a valuable resource in terms of manifold research that has been done in the domain of rule languages, but the syntax is not user-friendly.


R2ML allows usage for RuleML together with many other dialects. Really!?

% TODO RULE ENGINES!

%\section{Conclusion}
Most of the examined rule languages are designed for the interchangability of rules between different service providers. We do not attempt to jump into this domain but we rather pick up important concepts to manifest web API's as first class citizens of our rule language. This allows the ad-hoc design and implementation of reactive rules between existing web API's without the need for their cooperation in setting up their endpoint in a special way.
