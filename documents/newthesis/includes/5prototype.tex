% Describe rule engine. start from real engine over graphic engine why do we call ours engine

% Since the vision of on- and offline rules can't be covered with a single server application, the utilization of a fast, flexible and widely used technology such as JavaScript to tackle this challenge seems to be favorable future work. JavaScript was mainly invented for browsers and is spread all over the web by now. Additionally, applications such as \emph{node.js}, bring JavaScript to the server-side and tear down the communication efforts between cloud applications through JSON messages which are directly understood by modern browsers and cloud applications.
% Preferably a lightweighted rules engine would be used to run the user-generated mashups. T

% \section{Architecture}
Prototype consists of a queue in which all incoming events are pushed, and an engine that picks the events from the end of the queue whenever it is idle.
Since Prototype's core functionalty is the communication with resources in the Web, the architecture bases on HTTP protocol in several parts.
For example the events are meant to be retrieved completely via HTTP, the user interface is a Webpage which posts requests to the system and most actions are also meant to be HTTP requests, or at least using them to gather information.

During our research we found a troublesome server room that shows how the \textrm{Web of Things} can be exposed through our model.
This server room suffered from a defective cooling system which lead to a drastical increase of temperature in certain circumstances.
As a consequence certain server automatically shut themselves down as safety measurements.
Eventually, these shutdowns weren't detected immediately by the people that administered these servers, therefore unnecessary downtimes were the result.
As a very quick fix to inform certain administrators about the shutdown of their server, we started pinging these servers and pushed the results int

% NOTES / TODOs:

% Variable bindings
% Closures (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures)$
% Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. 
% In other words, the function defined in the closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created in.

% write about arallel as well?

Often, optimization approaches and programming language concepts require special attention to avoid common pitfalls.
When closures are used as asynchronous functions, developers need to be very careful not to end up with race conditions.


Looking at an example of sequential code execution in Figure~\ref{fig:Closures_Synchronous}, we see that function execution of \texttt{fA} is halted until function \texttt{fB} is finished.
If \texttt{fB} happens to be a latency-driven I/O operation the completion of \texttt{fA} could be deferred for a relatively long time.
While the application waits for the completion of the I/O operation, some remaining operations in \texttt{fA} could eventually already be executed without causing any race conditions.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
  \includegraphics{figures/Closures_Synchronous}
	\caption{Synchronous Function Call}
	\label{fig:Closures_Synchronous}
\end{figure}


Asynchronous code execution, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Closures_Asynchronous}, allows non-blocking and thus scalable applications.
Non-blocking operations are a remedy for optimzed resource allocation and open up ways to overcome previously described unnecessary resource bindings.
Processing any kind of latency-driven I/O operation asynchronously ( e.g. filesystem access and socket communication ) exploits resources that would otherwise be bound while waiting for completion.
Such operations are processed and completed whenever required resources are available.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
  \includegraphics{figures/Closures_Asynchronous}
	\caption{Asynchronous Function Call}
	\label{fig:Closures_Asynchronous}
\end{figure}


Often other operations depend on the completion of asynchronous operations, hence their execution needs to be deferred.
This necessary code execution deferral is achieved through the use of callback functions, denoted \texttt{fCB} in Figure~\ref{fig:Closures_Asynchronous}.
Any code placed in a callback function, which is assigned to an asynchronous operation, is only executed after the respective asynchronous operation completed.
This allows stacking of functions and operations upon each other which automatically results in a flexible and event-driven application.


Now we take closures into this asynchronous context, as defined in ECMAScript\cite{EcmaScript}, which is the base for widely-spread script languages like JavaScript, JScript and ActionScript.
Closures in ECMAScript\cite{EcmaScript} are defined such as they have access to the context of the function they were created in.
This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Closures_Closure-1} where \texttt{c} from \texttt{fA}'s context is accessible from within \texttt{fB}, assuming that \texttt{fB} was created in \texttt{fA} and not only invoked from there.
Using asynchronous closures it becomes evident, that the context in the invoking function can change while the closure is still computing and eventually referencing the outer context, thus causing race conditions.
This will be most obvious in a loop that immediately invokes \texttt{fB} several times, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Closures_Closure-2}.
In such a setup \texttt{c} will have different values in the same part of different invocations of \texttt{fB}.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
  \includegraphics{figures/Closures_Closure-1}
	\caption{Closure Scope and referenced context}
	\label{fig:Closures_Closure-1}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
  \includegraphics{figures/Closures_Closure-2}
	\caption{Closure context changes in a loop}
	\label{fig:Closures_Closure-2}
\end{figure}


Those event-driven context overwrites can be taken care of by shielding the closure from context changes, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Closures_Closure-3}.
To shield the closure form context changes, closure \texttt{fB} needs to create another closure \texttt{fC} and return it to \texttt{fA}.
The argument passed to \texttt{fB} is the context ( \texttt{c} in Figure~\ref{fig:Closures_Closure-3} ) that might change but requires to be persistent for one invocation.
\texttt{fC} has now \texttt{c} as a fixed context, which can't be overwritten anymore.
Now the only thing left is \texttt{fC} needs to be invoked and it will retain the original context.
This implementation is necessary when the closure acts as a callback function for asynchronous operations, to preserve the original context in case it is required within the callback function.

%In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, i.e. they are objects and can be manipulated and passed around just like any other object. Specifically, they are Function objects. -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope
% Since each call provides potentially different arguments, a new closure is created for each call to outside. The memory can be freed only when the returned inside is no longer accessible

% The definitive guide: This combination of a function object and a scope (a set of variable bindings) in which the function’s variables are resolved is called a closure in the computer science literature.4
% This is an old term that refers to the fact that the function’s variables have bindings in the scope chain and that therefore the function is “closed over” its variables.


Twelve Theses on Reactive Rules for the Web~\cite{10.1007-11896548_63}:
This article investigates issues of relevance in designing high-level
programming languages dedicated to reactivity on the Web. It presents
twelve theses on features desirable for a language of reactive rules tuned
to programming Web and Semantic Web applications.
% MY NOTES: they argue with soap and expect it to stay. They expect Web sites to inform each other about update requests. we are taking one step further and provide events to whomeever wants to receive them while being greedy about receiving events. give them to meeeeh my prciouzzz eventz!
% 1. High-level reactive languges are needed, ECA rules well-suited to specify reactivity
% 2. Reactive Web rules should be processed locally and act globally through event-based communication and access to persistent Web data
% 3. Events are best exchanged directly between Web sites in a push manner
% 4. Events are volatile data and should be kept distinct from persistent data.
% 5. Recognizing composite events is essential for a reactive Web language. Composite events are conveniently specified by (event) queries. There are (at least) four complementary dimensions to event queries: data extraction, event composition, temporal conditions, and event accumulation --> Future Work (CEP), data extraction already implemented
% 6. A data-driven, incremental evaluation of event queries is the approach of choice
% 7. Data from persistent Web resources plays an essential role for Web reactivity. A reactive language thus should embed or build upon a Web query language.
% 8. The Web is a dynamic, state-changing system. Reactions to state changes (events) through reactive rules are state-changing actions such as updates to persistent data. Reactive rules are needed where compound actions can be constructed from primitive actions.
% 9. Development and maintenance of reactive rule programs can be considerably supported by structuring mechanisms such as: branching in rules, deductive rules for event queries and Web queries, procedural abstractions for actions, and grouping of rules. --> Future work, attach several conditions and their actions branches to one event instead of creating rules for each of them. EC^nA^n. (Though procedural abstractions for actions already implemented, defining complex actions to be reused by rules)
% 10.Identity of data items is an issue for reactive languages due to their ability to react to changes of data objects on the Web. (we had surrogate identity though discarded the concept again... stupido)
% 11. Meta-programming and meta-circularity, that is, the ability to use rules to exchange and evaluate (other) rules, are needed in some important cases. (quite artificial for our scenarios)
% 12.Reactivity in the Web’s open and uncontrolled world requires language support for authentication, authorization, and accounting. (phew... let's let others go there)
