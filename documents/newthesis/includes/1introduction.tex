The Web is an ever growing institution\textit{(entity)}, in all aspects that it covers.
The number of information and functionality providers for the Web is growing in the whole spectrum from bigger computing centers down to smaller devices.
Computing centers, growing in size and quantity, allow for massive amounts of data to be stored and accessed, but they also enable the construction and accessibility of more complex functionalities.
Ever smaller devices provide informations and functionalities to the Web, through their quickly increasing number.
Many of them are even providing access to the Web itself and thus leverage the effect of the growing Web.
For example mobile phones can act as a hotspot to grant Web access to others through \textrm{WiFi}.
\index{Web of Things}
All the smart \textrm{Things} with access to the Web start to form the \textrm{Web of Things}~\cite{Guinard2011WoT}.
This can be every\textrm{Thing} from a temperature sensor to all electronical devices within a house.
These \textrm{Things} do not only provide sensor data but they can also be easily controlled through the Web.

\textbf{TODO use the word task or workflow?}

Confronted with this rapid growth of the Web, an increasing number of human beings is exposed to it in their daily life and they get literally flooded with data and possibilities to govern them.
Even though they have access to all these services in the Web, they often lack the knowledge, necessary time or right approach to weild them.
Users need ways to get appropriate informations, in the right moment, automatically and in a condensed matter that suits them best.
They have to be able to automate tedious tasks, e.g. detecting relevant changes in information resources and react on behalf of such changes.
% More concrete example?
This requires the identification of and filtering for user-specific information, appropriate timing, assembly and preprocessing of different information resources and finally the forwarding of outcomes to services in the web. 

Users don't want to be bound to specific services or applications, they want to use their preferred one, which they are used to and which helps them best to fulfill their needs.
Some of these services in the web offer ways to spread their data to other pre-defined services, but those are often mere copy/paste task.
Therefore users end up mashing informations or functionalities from different locations within the Web by hand.
This often means to execute similar tasks repeatedly by hand.
Moreover the completion of such a task suffers from latency due to the deferred detection of the initialization or because the user is just not able to execute the work at that time.
And also if the bits and pieces that form such a task could be separated, it is likely that some parts could be reused for other tasks or even by other people to get similar work done.

Since the data and the functionality already exists in the web, the users could automate their work to some extent by orchestrating services and data.
Even though the access to services and data gets simpler, the average user is still not able to program the Web.
Another challenge is that often a lot of effort needs to be invested, in understanding how the service works, before it can be fully exploited.
It is desirable to retain manageable mashing of servcies and data, while still exploiting their full potential.
There are a few possibilities in the Web that go towards easing the programmability of the Web, but they are either complicated to weild themselves or mere data copy or mashup approaches.

A big part of the informations, that become available to the users, are short-lived informations corresponding to certain state changes, and therefore can be modeled as events.
In this thesis we to introduce an event-driven conceptual model that enables programmability of the Web and through this imposes reactivity on the Web.
We claim the whole Web as our information space, in which we listen for triggered events and on which we execute actions as a result.
Such an user-specific reactivity allows a personalization of the whole Web and a tool to govern its information flood.
This would allow users to orchestrate the Web in an intuitive way.
Since current approaches concentrate on data flow rather than on event flow, which is mere data copy and spreading than reactivity, we believe that a conceptual model can overcome certain shortcomings of the existing solutions. % FIXME UGLY
